## Overview:  
Pulse is a web based fitness app which creates personalised workout plans generated by AI. Upon onboarding, it will ask users a number of questions regarding their goals, weight, height, experience, available equipment and lifestyle. Pulse AI will generate a workout plan tailored to their needs. It will adapt plans over time, track progress, and keep users motivated through simple gamification.

## Problem Statement:
Current fitness apps provide very generic and static workout routines which don’t adapt to a user's progress or circumstances (Injuries etc). Beginners can feel overwhelmed, and experienced lifters lack the ongoing personalisation.

## Core features: 
User Onboarding and Profile: Collects fitness goals, lifestyle details, and user preferences.

**AI Workout Planner:** Generates custom workout routines using the OpenAI API, orchestrated by Langflow.
**Progress Tracking:** Monitors workout sessions, key metrics, and displays progress through visual graphs.
**Motivation:** Incorporates gamification elements such as streaks, badges, and milestones.
**Adaptive Plans:** AI dynamically adjusts workout plans based on user feedback and logged results.

### Additional Features
**Calendar Component:** Allows users to select any date to view specific data, including workouts, water intake, and weight, presented in clear, visual charts.
**Badges and Achievements:** Engage users by awarding badges for consistent training, hydration, and achieving weight loss goals.

### Development
**Prerequisites**

Node.js 18+

pnpm 9+

Python 3.11+

Docker and Docker Compose

Supabase CLI (if running locally)

**Setup**
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd pulse
cp .env.example .env
pnpm install
```

**Run Services**
Start with Ai orcherstrator 
```bash
cd services/ai-orchestrator
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8001
```
**Start the API** (from root)
```bash
pnpm --filter api dev
```
**Start the web app** (from root)
```bash
pnpm --filter web dev
```
**Or run everything with Docker** (not setup yet)
```bash
docker compose -f infra/compose.dev.yaml up --build
```
### Access

Web: `http://localhost:3000`

API: `http://localhost:8000/health`

AI Orchestrator: `http://localhost:8001/health`


# Redis Setup for Pulse AI Orchestrator
Install Redis (Ubuntu/Debian)

`sudo apt update`
`sudo apt install redis-server`

**Start Redis**

`sudo systemctl start redis`

**Verify it's running**

`redis-cli ping`
**Expected response**: PONG

**Stop Redis**

`sudo systemctl stop redis`


**Notes**
Redis runs on localhost:6379 by default, no config changes needed, the app connects to this automatically.
Make sure Redis is running before starting the AI orchestrator service, otherwise the server will fail to start.
If you ever restart your machine and Redis isn't set to auto-start, you'll need to run `sudo systemctl start redis` again before starting the service.

### Git commit message types

**feat:** Introducing new features or significant improvements. 
**fix:** Bug fixes that resolve issues in your code. docs: Updates or additions to documentation. 
**style:** Cosmetic changes that don't affect code functionality (like formatting). 
**refactor:** Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature but improve structure. 
**test:** Everything about testing - adding or fixing tests. 
**chore:** Routine tasks or updates to the build process. 
**perf:** Enhancements that improve performance. 
**ci:** Modifications related to CI/CD processes. build: Changes affecting the build system or external dependencies. 
**revert:** Undoing previous changes.

### Git Flow / Branches Brach types, their distinct role, and the naming conventions:

**main:** The source of truth for production-ready states. 
**develop:** The integration branch for development work. 
**feature/:** For developing new features, e.g., feature/add-login. 
**release/:** Preparing a new production release, e.g., release/1.2.0. 
**hotfix/:** Quick fixes for the production version, e.g., hotfix/critical-login-bug. 
**support/:** Long-term support for older versions, e.g., support/1.x. 
**bugfix/:** For specific bug fixes (optional), e.g., bugfix/login-error.
